A computer program running on an ordinary operating system can see all resources (connected devices, files and folders, network shares, CPU power, quantifiable hardware capabilities) of that computer. However, programs running inside of a container can only see the container's contents and devices assigned to the container.",

Security practices and testing are performed earlier in the development lifecycle, hence the term ‘shift left’ can be used. DevSecOps empowers the developer by breaking down team silos and promoting the creation of secure, automated workflows and policy enforcement which provide the developer with timely and accurate information on how to move the project forward.",

In a cloud native environment, the individual parts typically run as containers on a cluster. In contrast with monolithic applications, if a node which is running on a distributed application goes down, another node can resume the task, thus eliminating a single point of failure.",

This is often with enforced via an automated process that overwrites unauthorized changes or through a system that won’t allow changes in the first place. Containers are an excellent example of immutable infrastructure because persistent changes to containers can only be made by creating a new version of the container or recreating the existing container from its image.",
