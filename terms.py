Such high-bandwidth link groups may be used to interconnect switches or to connect high-performance servers to a network. \n\n In the context of Ethernet VLANs, Cisco uses the term Ethernet trunking to mean carrying multiple VLANs through a single network link through the use of a trunking protocol. To allow for multiple VLANs on one link, frames from individual VLANs must be identified. The most common and preferred method, IEEE 802.1Q adds a tag to the Ethernet frame, labeling it as belonging to a certain VLAN.
